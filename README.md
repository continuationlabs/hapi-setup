hapi plugin that exposes a `setup` method for retrieving the server configuration. Provides information such as the version of Node running, the hapi server connections, routing tables per connection, and plugin information.

## Example Usage

The example below registers the `hapi-setup` plugin. In the handler for the `/about` route, the `hapi-setup.setup()` function is executed, which returns an object, and the result is then used to reply to the incoming request.

```js
var server = new Hapi.Server();
server.connection();

server.register(require('hapi-setup'), function (err) {
  server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/about',
    handler: function (request, reply) {
      reply(request.server.plugins['hapi-setup'].setup());
    }
  })
});

```
